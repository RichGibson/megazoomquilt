personal high resolution panorama exploration and diplay

I worked on the original [gigapan.com](gigapan.com) project, from 2008-2012. I loved
Gigapans. My Facebook name is 'gigapanner.' And then time happened. 

Megazoomquilt is a server based system to allow you to explore and display 
high resolution imagery.

It can run on your local machine as a Flask app, or you can run it in the cloud.

It will be the backend for [MegaZoomQuilt.com](megazoomquilt.com)

If you have thoughts or ideas on how to extend the code or the website please
let me know [Rich.Gibson@gmail.com](mailto:rich.gibson@gmail.com)

## To run

flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5001 --reload
